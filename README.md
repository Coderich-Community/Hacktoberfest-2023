Throughout October 2023, all you need to do is contribute to any open-source project and merge at least four pull requests. Yes, you can choose any project and any type of contribution. You don't need to be an expert coder; it could be a bug fix, an improvement, or even a documentation update!

Hacktoberfest welcomes participants from all corners of our global community. Whether you're an experienced developer, a coding enthusiast just starting out, an event organizer, or a company of any size, you can help drive the growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-expanding community. People from diverse backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to take part.

## 🤔 Why Should I Contribute?

Hacktoberfest has a straightforward goal: to promote open source and reward those who contribute to it.

However, it's not just about the T-shirts and stickers; it's about supporting and celebrating open source while giving back to the community.

## 👨‍💻 What Can I Contribute?

Hacktoberfest is inclusive and open to everyone, regardless of your background or skill level. Whether you're a seasoned developer, a student learning to code, an event host, or a company of any size, you can help foster the growth of open source and make meaningful contributions to a thriving community.

Contributions don't have to be limited to code; they can include documentation updates or fixing typos.

You can contribute to any open source project hosted on GitHub.com between October 1 and October 31, 2023. Look for issues labeled with "hacktoberfest" or "good-first-issue" on GitHub; these are typically beginner-friendly and easy to tackle.
